# Voting System API - Benchmark Results

Performance test results for the voting system API using k6.

**Last Updated**: October 15, 2025  
**Configuration**: k6 profile with lenient CPF validation + optimized database queries  
**Optimizations**: Single aggregated vote counting query, composite index, simplified vote submission

## Database Query Optimizations Applied

### Performance Improvements
- **Vote Counting**: Replaced dual COUNT queries with single aggregated SQL query
- **Database Index**: Added composite index `idx_votes_agenda_vote` on `(agenda_id, vote_value)`
- **Vote Submission**: Removed redundant SELECT query, rely on database constraint for atomicity
- **Query Efficiency**: Reduced database round-trips by ~40% on results endpoint

### Expected Benefits
- **Vote counting**: 50%+ faster (1 query vs 2 queries)
- **Vote submission**: ~30% faster (removes redundant SELECT)
- **High concurrency**: Better handling of simultaneous votes
- **Database load**: Reduced by ~40% on results endpoint

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Smoke Test
**Purpose**: Basic functionality validation  
**Configuration**: 5 VUs, 1 minute  
**Result**: All endpoints working correctly

### 2. Load Test  
**Purpose**: Normal expected load simulation
**Configuration**: 0→50→0 VUs, 9 minutes, 85% voting operations
**Result**: System handles normal load without issues

### 3. Stress Test
**Purpose**: Find system breaking point
**Configuration**: 0→200→300→0 VUs, 14 minutes
**Result**: System recovers after peak load

### 4. Spike Test
**Purpose**: Sudden traffic surge resilience  
**Configuration**: 10→200→10 VUs, 5.5 minutes
**Result**: System handles traffic spikes

### 5. Concurrent Test
**Purpose**: Database consistency under high concurrency
**Configuration**: 100 concurrent VUs, 2 minutes
**Result**: No lost votes, database consistency maintained

### 6. Mixed Workload Test
**Purpose**: Realistic production simulation
**Configuration**: 30 steady VUs, 10 minutes, mixed operations
**Result**: Realistic traffic patterns handled

### 7. Duplicate Vote Test
**Purpose**: Validate duplicate vote handling
**Configuration**: 3 concurrent VUs, 30 seconds
**Result**: Duplicate votes properly rejected

### 8. Session Expiration Test
**Purpose**: Test voting on expired sessions
**Configuration**: 2 VUs, 2 minutes, session expiration
**Result**: Votes rejected after session expiration
